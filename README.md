# Air Pollution Analysis
This repository contains our project about the data collecting about the air pollution in some cities. We will use the API of [OpenWeatherMap air pollution API](https://openweathermap.org/api/air-pollution) to track data about polluting gases, such as Carbon monoxide (CO), Nitrogen monoxide (NO), Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), Ozone (O3), Sulphur dioxide (SO2), Ammonia (NH3), and particulates (PM2.5 and PM10) and the Air Quality Index levels(AQI)
## Setup
- Clone this repository
- You have to define a `.env` and create a variable where you put your **API key** from the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org) (you have to create an account and the API key will be available after you created it). The schema about the environment variable is in the `.env.local` file
